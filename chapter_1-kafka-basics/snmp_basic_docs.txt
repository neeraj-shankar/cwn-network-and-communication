What do we understand about SNMP
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SNMP, or Simple Network Management Protocol, is a protocol used in network management systems to monitor and manage 
network-attached devices. 

It is an essential tool for network administrators and IT professionals to maintain and troubleshoot networks efficiently. 
SNMP allows you to collect information and perform various operations on network devices, such as routers, switches, 
servers, and printers.

Here's a basic overview of SNMP:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Components of SNMP:
-----------------------------------------------------------
SNMP consists of three key components:
-----------------------------
1. Managed Devices: These are the network devices you want to monitor or manage, like routers, switches, servers, and printers.

2. SNMP Agents: These are software modules or processes running on managed devices. Agents collect and store management information
   and make it available to SNMP managers.

3. SNMP Managers: These are the systems or applications responsible for monitoring and managing network devices. Managers send 
   SNMP requests to agents to retrieve information and configure devices.

SNMP Versions:
-----------------------------
There are several versions of SNMP, with SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and SNMPv3 being the most commonly used. SNMPv3 is the most secure 
and feature-rich version, while SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c are less secure and lack some of the advanced features.

MIB (Management Information Base):
-----------------------------
The MIB is a database that describes the managed objects in a device. It defines a structure for organizing and accessing information. 
MIB objects are represented hierarchically and are identified by Object Identifiers (OIDs).

SNMP Operations:
-----------------------------
SNMP operations are categorized into two types:

GET: SNMP managers can request specific information from managed devices by sending GET requests. The agent responds with the requested data.
SET: SNMP managers can modify the configuration of managed devices by sending SET requests. Agents make changes based on the request.

SNMP Traps/Inform Requests:
-----------------------------
SNMP agents can send unsolicited notifications called SNMP traps (in SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c) or inform requests (in SNMPv3) to SNMP managers. 
These notifications are typically used to inform managers about specific events or issues on the network.

Security in SNMPv3:
-----------------------------
SNMPv3 offers improved security features compared to SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c. It includes authentication and encryption options to secure 
the communication between agents and managers. This is important for protecting sensitive information on the network.



MIB VS SNMP Traps
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MIB (Management Information Base):
-----------------------------------------------------------

Definition: MIB is a database or structure that describes the managed objects on a network device. It defines the structure
            and organization of the data that can be accessed and managed through SNMP. MIB objects are identified by Object 
            Identifiers (OIDs), and they represent various parameters and attributes of network devices.

Purpose: MIB serves as a repository of information that SNMP managers can query (GET) to retrieve data from network devices 
         or use to configure (SET) those devices. It is the foundation for SNMP communication and allows for standardized and 
         organized access to device information.

Use Case: When you want to retrieve information from a network device or configure specific parameters, you use MIB objects. 
          For example, you can use MIB objects to check the CPU utilization of a router or set the community string for SNMP access.


SNMP Traps:
-----------------------------------------------------------
Definition: SNMP traps are unsolicited notifications sent by SNMP agents (network devices) to SNMP managers (network monitoring systems)
            to inform them about specific events, issues, or alarms. Traps are typically triggered by predefined conditions, such as a 
            link going down, high CPU usage, or an interface error.

Purpose: SNMP traps are used for real-time event notification. When a specific condition occurs on a network device, the SNMP agent sends
         a trap to the SNMP manager to alert it to the situation. Traps provide a way for devices to proactively report issues without being 
         explicitly queried by the manager.

Use Case: SNMP traps are valuable for network monitoring, as they allow network administrators to receive immediate notifications about 
          network problems, outages, or performance issues. For example, if a critical server goes offline, the server's SNMP agent can 
          send a trap to the SNMP manager, enabling rapid response to the issue.

summary
-----------------------------------------------------------
In summary, MIB is primarily about structured data retrieval and device configuration, allowing SNMP managers to query and set values on 
network devices. On the other hand, SNMP traps are about event notification and alerting, enabling SNMP agents to inform SNMP managers 
about specific events or issues as they happen. Both MIB and traps are vital components of SNMP and are used together to effectively monitor 
and manage network devices.
